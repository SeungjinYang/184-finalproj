<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>

<p>We will increase the functionality of our raytracer from Project 3, we will add light field camera support, where each pixel is now a grid that records radiance from different directions. With this, we will add adjustment and refocusing capabilities. To measure our success, we will provide an interface and compare refocused images with images rendered with the standard thin lens ray tracing.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Problem description</h2>

<p>From Project 3, thin lens rendering gives a more photorealistic rendering than a pinhole model as it gives a field of depth. However, once rendered, the image cannot be refocused. Thus, to get the best rendered image, we first made a ballpark measure of conditions by running multiple renderings on low settings before rendering with full settings. By introducing the light field camera, we will be able to render images without selecting a specific focal point on the image using microlens arrays that can make refocus-able images after rendering. 
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is to implement a light field camera by building on the thin lens model in Project 3 using a microlens array as shown in Fig.1. We will do so after reading up on the light field camera model and getting familiar with the mathematical functions associated with it, which we have linked in the “Resources” portion. After doing so, we will want to render images like those in Fig.2, wherein we can refocus the image on the left with a short focal length to render the image on the right with a long focal length.</p>

<p>If time permits, with the model, we will also build an interactive model for comparison with the thin lens and pinhole model, using the Project 3 GUI as a starting point. We want this model to be able to refocus the images by changing the focal length and the lens aperture on the scene. We might also implement more functionality into our GUI that would allow the users to filter the image by toggling brightness, sharpness, contrast, and saturation to produce a more desirable image.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Deliverables</h2>

<p>We plan to deliver images generated with plenoptic light field support that be refocused after rendering, images generated with thin lens model for comparison purposes, and an interface to manipulate lens aperture and focus of such image generated by light field support. We also want to generate pictures of some intermediate steps, for example, a grid of sub-aperture images.
</p>

<p>We hope to deliver images generated with different lens models and create an (improved) interactive interface to compare results.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Metric of success</h2>
<p>A light field camera seeks to manipulate the lens characteristic of the image after rendering. We will measure the effectiveness of light field support by comparing images generated by light field with renderings generated by normal thin lens model at multiple lens configurations.

<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Until April 11:
Read the resources and understand the mechanics of light field camera. Understand proj3 code in its entirety to determine what stage of the pipeline needs modifications.</li><br>

<li>Until April 18:
Determine the modification required from project 3 code and implement the light field camera model so it can generate sub-aperture images.</li><br>

<li>Until April 25:
Generate images focused on an arbitrary distance given the array of sub-aperture images. Make an interface to read the file and display images to different lens settings.</li><br>

<li>Until April 30 (milestone submission deadline):
Render deliverable images and construct milestone webpage. If we are ahead of schedule, work on aspiration goals.</li><br>

<li>Until May 10 (presentation deadline):
Work on final deliverables.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Project 3 code: It already has support for thin lens model, and we believe changing how light intensity is stored for each pixel will give light field support.
